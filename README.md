# OVERVIEW

This is a clone of [this repo](https://github.com/KarlHeitmann/chuletas_cleanup) but written in Rust. It is _blazingly fast_ in comparison to ruby.

There is still a lot of work to do here, like print in which line of the file the change offensive word is. Tests are needed. Need to extract the vector of
offensive words outside the code. So the binary will have access to it and you can change the offensive words on the fly, without compiling again this code.
Extend the files searched to include other languages (rust, python, javascript, etc).
